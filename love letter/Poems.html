    I was speaking to Vanessa,
    half-awake, half-alive,
    when she opened a door
    I didn’t know existed—
    and you walked in
    with the calm of a girl
    who has survived storms.
</div>

<div class="poem-section">
    She warned me about you.
    Said your heart was a country
    recently wounded by war.
    Said you don’t hand out your number
    because your trust
    is stitched with trembling fingers.
</div>

<div class="poem-section">
    But what she didn’t understand
    is that some women
    are not asked for —
    they are summoned
    by a man’s fate.
</div>

<div class="poem-section">
    So I insisted.
    Not because I wanted you—
    wanting is too small a word—
    but because something inside me
    recognized you
    the way deserts recognize rain.
</div>

<div class="poem-section">
    She added you to the call
    and the world stopped.
    Three seconds of silence
    louder than a lifetime.
    You spoke, softly—
    and my name learned
    how to kneel.
</div>

<div class="poem-section">
    When you finally gave me your line,
    I wrote to you
    as if writing to my own pulse.
    And you replied
    as if you had been waiting
    for someone reckless enough
    to believe in you again.
</div>
<div class="poem-section">
    For seven nights
    your messages touched me
    through the glass of a screen,
    and I swear
    I have never been held
    more gently.
</div>

<div class="poem-section">
    And when we met—
    when my eyes saw you
    unfiltered,
    untranslated,
    untouched by distance—
    I understood
    why some loves
    are written before birth
    and revealed
    only when two hearts
    are ready to surrender.
